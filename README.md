# codevision-web
The website for the Codevision organization.

## About the Project
This project is aimed to make a finished and maintained product, in this case a website, to the Codevision organization.

## For developers
The recommended Node version is 6.11.2.
For development purposes, you might want to use a Mongo database from [mLab](https://mlab.com/) if you don't have one available.

To run, you'll need to set a few environment variables.
Enter the following commands seperately in your command prompt and execute them in the same directory as the web content:

`SET PORT=<Port>` (default: 3000)

`SET SESSIONSECRET="<Random session secret key>"`

`SET DATABASEURL=<MongoDB URI>`
